# TODO: Update Code for New Database Schema

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update models/Child.js to use 'family_members' instead of 'children'
- [x] Update models/admin.js to use 'families' and 'family_members' instead of 'family' and 'children', adjusting queries to fetch equivalent data

## Summary
The code has been updated to align with the new database schema (users, admins, families, persons, family_members) without changing the underlying logic. All model functions now query the appropriate tables and maintain the same functionality.
